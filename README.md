# Simple-PC
This project aims to create a 12-bit simple computer. The project was done using Quartus Prime Lite 20.1.1

Currently finished:
- CLA - 4 bit Carry Look Ahead adder
- ALU - 32 bit ALU
  
Under Construction:
- Shifter - Which can shift by 8 positions
- Main PC Part
- Display

PS: The readme originally said 32-bit ALU, that was the aim. But I wanted to make it a bit more than that and to be so that I could implement it on the DE2-115 board I recently got for this year from the department of Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering - University of Moratuwa - Sri Lanka
