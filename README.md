# Simple-ALU
This project Aims to create a 32-bit ALU to be used in future projects. The project was done using Quartus Prime Lite 20.1.1

Currently finished:
- CLA - 4 bit Carry Look Ahead adder

Under Construction:
- ALU - 32 bit ALU
- Shifter - Which can shift by 8 positions

Currently the ALU and the CLA can add and subtract a 32 bit unsigned integer. But now I'm modifying it to be able to perform calculations on IEEE754 numbers
